	Strategy: what are the goals? Are there courses, already successful, that we can use as models?<br>
	Design: what's the best way to make the change happen in the learner? how can we support and increase engagement?<br>
	Technology: with my technical background I can manage specialised freelancers that can implement the actual platform that will deliver the course<br><br>

	Before focussing 100% on designing and developing online courses I have been consulting, designing and developing for big brands (like the one you see here). Of course, because I'm a one-man-band I usually got the sale through agencies and intermediates. But nevertheless the platforms I've helped build are still delivering.
